In terms of what I have learnt since yesterday, the python redis library must be installed in
the bash terminal. However, redis is a linux native library, therefore I needed to install a
linux distribution.

I opted to use the WSL subsytem linux, however, due to compatibility issues and lack of storage,
I required an alternative way to run redis-server.

I found a old computer, that barely ran windows 11 at acceptable performance. I downloaded and
flashed a copy of the ubuntu server in a flash storage drive. The ubuntu server package is
lightweight and highly functional. Installing 3rd party drivers for the internet module and the
processor was fairly easy as well.

A challenge occured, where typing commands in terminal took extremely long and connecting to my
Github account was becoming a hassle. The solution I came up with was to install remote ssh,
and connect from my previous computer system thorugh terminal.

A multitude of benefits:

-access to copy and paste function

-ability to multitask in terms of documentation

-use AI to boost my productivity.

-due to the low power consumption, i can run it 24/7

-connecting to Github became very easy

but i ran into a different problem, to run any python file, i required to run it in a virtual 
environment. at first i assumed the issue was related due to me remote terminal. However, I 
discovered that was not the case because the same error happened when i was using the machine.

So I read trhough the documentation provided online and used venv to create a local environment.
I installed pandas, redis and a few more libraries and softwares. And was able to write my first 
script, and run it in the redis server. It was successfull.
